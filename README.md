# Acropora-hemprichii-genome-assembly-and-annotation
This repository contains detail script for the genome assembly and annotation of the coral Acropora hemprichii combining short and long reads.

# ASSEMBLY
Short reads were preprocessed checking for quality, removing universal adapters, removing PCR duplicates and filtering out contaminant reads that align to Symbiodiniaceae, bacteria or viruses (sensu Buitrago-Lopez, 2020). 
Filtered paired-end reads were used to assembled a denovo genome using the program DISCOVAR (sensu Buitrago-Lopez, 2020). Long reads were then used to ...
