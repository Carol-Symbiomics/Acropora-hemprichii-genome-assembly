# Acropora-hemprichii-genome-assembly
This repository contains detail script for the genome assembly and annotation of the coral Acropora hemprichii combining short and long reads.

Short reads were preprocessed checking for quality, removing universal adapters, removing PCR duplicates and filtering out contaminant reads that align to Symbiodiniaceae, bacteria or viruses (sensu Buitrago-Lopez, 2020). 
Filtered paired-end reads were used to assembled a denovo genome using the program DISCOVAR (sensu Buitrago-Lopez, 2020)
